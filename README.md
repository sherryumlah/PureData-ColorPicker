# PureData-ColorPicker
This is a simple script that allows you to pick a hex/RGB color and convert it to a pure data color.

Pure Data (aka Pd) is an open source visual programming language that can run on anything from personal computers and Raspberry Pis to smartphones (via libpd, pddroidparty, and Rjdj).
